# Fashion MNIST using Neural Networks

This repository contains code to classify Fashion MNIST dataset using neural networks implemented in Keras.

## Overview
Fashion MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. The goal is to classify these images into their respective categories.

## Requirements
- Python (>= 3.6)
- Keras
- TensorFlow (or other Keras backend)

*Python*: Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in various domains including web development, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and data analysis.

*Keras*: Keras is an open-source neural network library written in Python. It is designed for easy and fast experimentation with deep neural networks and runs on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. Keras provides a simple and intuitive API for building and training deep learning models.

*TensorFlow*: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources for building and deploying machine learning models at scale. TensorFlow supports various high-level APIs including Keras for building and training deep neural networks.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the model script.
